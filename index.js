/*Create a GET route on /pokemon which gives the complete list of pokemon from the JSON
Create a GET route on /pokemon/:id which gives only one pokemon from the JSON thanks to its id
(Optional) Create a GET route on /pokemon/:id/:info (<name>|<type>|<base>) which gives only one pokemon from the JSON thanks to its id and retrieve only one information (name or type or base) to send back to the client
(Optional): Use the MVC pattern; your routes should be managed by a router; which in return triggers a controller that will access the correct Pokemon resources
Enable all the CORS: https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html */
